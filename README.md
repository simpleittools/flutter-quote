# Flutter Quote

I made this to learn more about Flutter.
I also made a version using Go/Fyne. The Go/Fyne version can be
found [here](https://github.com/simpleittools/fyne-quote)

This project was inspired by a JavaScript course from [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io)
by [JacIntoDesign](https://github.com/JacintoDesign). \
There are 8000 quotes embedded in the file. The quotes were acquired from
https://jacintodesign.github.io/quotes-api/data/quotes.json \
There are another 100 quotes that have been added
from https://gist.github.com/nasrulhazim/54b659e43b1035215cd0ba1d4577ee80
